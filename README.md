**Opinions**

The goal of this project is to recommend a list of animes to individuals based on an anime they have seen in the past and, to determine what are the leading animes based on the different genres we have in the database(e.g Isekai, Shounen, Seinen, Slice of Life, Josei, Shoujo,...)

This could be used for people who need manga recommendation based on certain anime that they have seen and enjoyed or people who want to watch the top anime in a particular genre of their preference.

As of now the database is composed of around 19000 anime stored in an excel datasheet but this could easily be extended to include newer animes and even some mangas, manhwas and manhuas.
